# KR4EKT Website

This site is intended to be used by people who have a very limited connection, or even those who would prefer to just download the entire site onto their phone.

The footprint of this site is intended to be tiny, within 10MB total. Each page of text should stay within 10kB while included web tools should be less than 50kB total load.

I made this site because I enjoy outdoor operations in areas where cellphone service may be limited. After all, with a radio you can even receive website data if you are patient enough and this site's mission is to be as limited in bandwidth usage as possible.

## Resources

The resources page is intended to include as much material for getting where you need as possible. Obviously, with a lightweight implementation in mind, there will be missing things. I have linked to other sites which are much more wealthy and expansive. It is possible as this project grows I will include a link to my own, less rugged site for those who are not limited by spotty cell signal or no signal at all.

The tools on the site are completely homebrew. Anything running on the site will need to be able to do so within a static site, since I am not implementing a database or any fancy gadgetry on the backend. This site is almost pure HTML.

## Tools

The tools included will have their own repositories along with potentially more featureful implementations of them. The tools included on this site are intended to be very basic and easy to use in any situation, providing the essentials.
